@book{Nocedal1999,
abstract = {Numerical Optimization presents a comprehensive and up-to-date description of the most effective methods in continuous optimization. It responds to the growing interest in optimization in engineering, science, and business by focusing on the methods that are best suited to practical problems. Drawing on their experiences in teaching, research, and consulting, the authors have produced a textbook that will be of interest to students and practitioners alike. Each chapter begins with the basic concepts and builds up gradually to the best techniques currently available. Because of the emphasis on practical methods, as well as the extensive illustrations and exercises, the book is accessible to a wide audience. It can be used as a graduate text in engineering, operations research, mathematics, computer science, and business. It also serves as a handbook for researchers and practitioners in the field. Above all, the authors have strived to produce a text that is pleasant to read, informative, and rigorous - one that reveals both the beautiful nature of the discipline and its practical side. MMOR Mathematical Methods of Operations Research, 2001: "The book looks very suitable to be used in an graduate-level course in optimization for students in mathematics, operations research, engineering, and others. Moreover, it seems to be very helpful to do some self-studies in optimization, to complete own knowledge and can be a source of new ideas.... I recommend this excellent book to everyone who is interested in optimization problems."},

@article{Cardinali2004,
abstract = {The influence matrix is used in ordinary least-squares applications for monitoring statistical multiple-regression analyses. Concepts related to the influence matrix provide diagnostics on the influence of individual data on the analysis - the analysis change that would occur by leaving one observation out, and the effective information content (degrees of freedom for signal) in any sub-set of the analysed data. In this paper, the corresponding concepts have been derived in the context of linear statistical data assimilation in numerical weather prediction. An approximate method to compute the diagonal elements of the influence matrix (the self-sensitivities) has been developed for a large-dimension variational data assimilation system (the four-dimensional variational system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). Results show that, in the boreal spring 2003 operational system, 15\% of the global influence is due to the assimilated observations in any one analysis, and the complementary 85\% is the influence of the prior (background) information, a short-range forecast containing information from earlier assimilated observations. About 25\% of the observational information is currently provided by surface-based observing systems, and 75\% by satellite systems. 
Low-influence data points usually occur in data-rich areas, while high-influence data points are in data-sparse areas or in dynamically active regions. Background-error correlations also play an important role: high correlation diminishes the observation influence and amplifies the importance of the surrounding real and pseudo observations (prior information in observation space). Incorrect specifications of background and observation-error covariance matrices can be identified, interpreted and better understood by the use of influence-matrix diagnostics for the variety of observation types and observed variables used in the data assimilation system.

abstract = {Observation error statistics are required in most atmospheric data assimilation systems. While observation errors are often assumed to be spatially correlated, serial correlations have received virtually no attention. In this article, the effect of serially correlated observation error is examined in the context of Kalman filter theory. It is shown that for spatially uncorrelated observation errors, serial correlations will only be detrimental for rapid-sampling instruments or low-flow regimes. In standard Kalman filter theory, it is assumed that the model error is not serially correlated. This assumption has been questioned in the past. In this article, certain types of serially correlated model errors are shown to have a serious detrimental effect on atmospheric data assimilation. It is also suggested that certain performance diagnostics may be capable of detecting serial correlations.},

@book{Nocedal1999,
abstract = {Numerical Optimization presents a comprehensive and up-to-date description of the most effective methods in continuous optimization. It responds to the growing interest in optimization in engineering, science, and business by focusing on the methods that are best suited to practical problems. Drawing on their experiences in teaching, research, and consulting, the authors have produced a textbook that will be of interest to students and practitioners alike. Each chapter begins with the basic concepts and builds up gradually to the best techniques currently available. Because of the emphasis on practical methods, as well as the extensive illustrations and exercises, the book is accessible to a wide audience. It can be used as a graduate text in engineering, operations research, mathematics, computer science, and business. It also serves as a handbook for researchers and practitioners in the field. Above all, the authors have strived to produce a text that is pleasant to read, informative, and rigorous - one that reveals both the beautiful nature of the discipline and its practical side. MMOR Mathematical Methods of Operations Research, 2001: "The book looks very suitable to be used in an graduate-level course in optimization for students in mathematics, operations research, engineering, and others. Moreover, it seems to be very helpful to do some self-studies in optimization, to complete own knowledge and can be a source of new ideas.... I recommend this excellent book to everyone who is interested in optimization problems."},

@article{Cardinali2004,
abstract = {The influence matrix is used in ordinary least-squares applications for monitoring statistical multiple-regression analyses. Concepts related to the influence matrix provide diagnostics on the influence of individual data on the analysis - the analysis change that would occur by leaving one observation out, and the effective information content (degrees of freedom for signal) in any sub-set of the analysed data. In this paper, the corresponding concepts have been derived in the context of linear statistical data assimilation in numerical weather prediction. An approximate method to compute the diagonal elements of the influence matrix (the self-sensitivities) has been developed for a large-dimension variational data assimilation system (the four-dimensional variational system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). Results show that, in the boreal spring 2003 operational system, 15\% of the global influence is due to the assimilated observations in any one analysis, and the complementary 85\% is the influence of the prior (background) information, a short-range forecast containing information from earlier assimilated observations. About 25\% of the observational information is currently provided by surface-based observing systems, and 75\% by satellite systems. 
Low-influence data points usually occur in data-rich areas, while high-influence data points are in data-sparse areas or in dynamically active regions. Background-error correlations also play an important role: high correlation diminishes the observation influence and amplifies the importance of the surrounding real and pseudo observations (prior information in observation space). Incorrect specifications of background and observation-error covariance matrices can be identified, interpreted and better understood by the use of influence-matrix diagnostics for the variety of observation types and observed variables used in the data assimilation system.

abstract = {Observation error statistics are required in most atmospheric data assimilation systems. While observation errors are often assumed to be spatially correlated, serial correlations have received virtually no attention. In this article, the effect of serially correlated observation error is examined in the context of Kalman filter theory. It is shown that for spatially uncorrelated observation errors, serial correlations will only be detrimental for rapid-sampling instruments or low-flow regimes. In standard Kalman filter theory, it is assumed that the model error is not serially correlated. This assumption has been questioned in the past. In this article, certain types of serially correlated model errors are shown to have a serious detrimental effect on atmospheric data assimilation. It is also suggested that certain performance diagnostics may be capable of detecting serial correlations.},

@article{Walter2013,
abstract = {Many programs for scientific computing in Python are based on NumPy and therefore make heavy use of numerical linear algebra (NLA) functions, vectorized operations, slicing and broadcasting. AlgoPy provides the means to compute derivatives of arbitrary order and Taylor approximations of such programs. The approach is based on a combination of univariate Taylor polynomial arithmetic and matrix calculus in the (combined) forward/reverse mode of Algorithmic Differentiation (AD). In contrast to existing AD tools, vectorized operations and NLA functions are not considered to be a sequence of scalar elementary functions. Instead, dedicated algorithms for the matrix product, matrix inverse and the Cholesky, QR, and symmetric eigenvalue decomposition are implemented in AlgoPy. We discuss the reasons for this alternative approach and explain the underlying idea. Examples illustrate how AlgoPy can be used from a user's point of view.},

abstract = {Abstract Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (VDA) experiments have been carded out using the adiabatic version of the NASA/Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit (SLSI) multilevel general circulation model. The limited-memory quasi-Newton minimization technique was used to find the minimum of the cost friction. With model-generated observations, different first-guess initial conditions were used to carry out the experiments. The experiments included randomly perturbed initial conditions, as well as different weight matrices in the cost function. The results show that 4D VDA works well with various initial conditions as control variables. Scaling the gradient of the cost function proves to be an effective method of improving the convergence rate of the VDA minimization process. The impacts of the length of the assimilation interval and the time density of the observations on the convergence rate of the minimization have also been investigated. An improved assimilation ...},

@article{Navon1992,
abstract = {Abstract Variational four-dimensional (4D) data assimilation is performed using an adiabatic version of the National Meteorological Center (NMC) baroclinic spectral primitive equation model with operationally analyzed fields as well as simulated datasets. Two limited-memory quasi-Newton minimization techniques were used to iteratively find the minimum of a cost function, with the NMC forecast as a constraint. The cost function consists of a weighted square sum of the differences between the model forecast and observations over a time interval. In all the experiments described in this paper, observations are available for all degrees of freedom of the model. The derivation of the adjoint of the discretized adiabatic NMC spectral model is presented. The creation of this adjoint model allows the gradient of the cost function with respect to the initial conditions to be computed using a single backward-in-time integration of the adjoint equations. As an initial evaluation of the variational data-assimilation ...},

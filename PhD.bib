@article{Fowler2012,
abstract = {Non-Gaussian/non-linear data assimilation is becoming an increasingly important area of research in the Geosciences as the resolution and non-linearity of models are increased and more and more non-linear observation operators are being used. In this study, we look at the effect of relaxing the assumption of a Gaussian prior on the impact of observations within the data assimilation system. Three different measures of observation impact are studied: the sensitivity of the posterior mean to the observations, mutual information and relative entropy. The sensitivity of the posterior mean is derived analytically when the prior is modelled by a simplified Gaussian mixture and the observation errors are Gaussian. It is found that the sensitivity is a strong function of the value of the observation and proportional to the posterior variance. Similarly, relative entropy is found to be a strong function of the value of the observation. However, the errors in estimating these two measures using a Gaussian approximation to the prior can differ significantly. This hampers conclusions about the effect of the non-Gaussian prior on observation impact. Mutual information does not depend on the value of the observation and is seen to be close to its Gaussian approximation. These findings are illustrated with the particle filter applied to the Lorenz '63 system. This article is concluded with a discussion of the appropriateness of these measures of observation impact for different situations.

@book{Nocedal1999,
abstract = {Numerical Optimization presents a comprehensive and up-to-date description of the most effective methods in continuous optimization. It responds to the growing interest in optimization in engineering, science, and business by focusing on the methods that are best suited to practical problems. Drawing on their experiences in teaching, research, and consulting, the authors have produced a textbook that will be of interest to students and practitioners alike. Each chapter begins with the basic concepts and builds up gradually to the best techniques currently available. Because of the emphasis on practical methods, as well as the extensive illustrations and exercises, the book is accessible to a wide audience. It can be used as a graduate text in engineering, operations research, mathematics, computer science, and business. It also serves as a handbook for researchers and practitioners in the field. Above all, the authors have strived to produce a text that is pleasant to read, informative, and rigorous - one that reveals both the beautiful nature of the discipline and its practical side. MMOR Mathematical Methods of Operations Research, 2001: "The book looks very suitable to be used in an graduate-level course in optimization for students in mathematics, operations research, engineering, and others. Moreover, it seems to be very helpful to do some self-studies in optimization, to complete own knowledge and can be a source of new ideas.... I recommend this excellent book to everyone who is interested in optimization problems."},

abstract = {Observation error statistics are required in most atmospheric data assimilation systems. While observation errors are often assumed to be spatially correlated, serial correlations have received virtually no attention. In this article, the effect of serially correlated observation error is examined in the context of Kalman filter theory. It is shown that for spatially uncorrelated observation errors, serial correlations will only be detrimental for rapid-sampling instruments or low-flow regimes. In standard Kalman filter theory, it is assumed that the model error is not serially correlated. This assumption has been questioned in the past. In this article, certain types of serially correlated model errors are shown to have a serious detrimental effect on atmospheric data assimilation. It is also suggested that certain performance diagnostics may be capable of detecting serial correlations.},

abstract = {Many programs for scientific computing in Python are based on NumPy and therefore make heavy use of numerical linear algebra (NLA) functions, vectorized operations, slicing and broadcasting. AlgoPy provides the means to compute derivatives of arbitrary order and Taylor approximations of such programs. The approach is based on a combination of univariate Taylor polynomial arithmetic and matrix calculus in the (combined) forward/reverse mode of Algorithmic Differentiation (AD). In contrast to existing AD tools, vectorized operations and NLA functions are not considered to be a sequence of scalar elementary functions. Instead, dedicated algorithms for the matrix product, matrix inverse and the Cholesky, QR, and symmetric eigenvalue decomposition are implemented in AlgoPy. We discuss the reasons for this alternative approach and explain the underlying idea. Examples illustrate how AlgoPy can be used from a user's point of view.},

The limited-memory quasi-Newton minimization technique was used to find the minimum of the cost friction. With model-generated observations, different first-guess initial conditions were used to carry out the experiments. The experiments included randomly perturbed initial conditions, as well as different weight matrices in the cost function. The results show that 4D VDA works well with various initial conditions as control variables. Scaling the gradient of the cost function proves to be an effective method of improving the convergence rate of the VDA minimization process. The impacts of the length of the assimilation interval and the time density of the observations on the convergence rate of the minimization have also been investigated. An improved assimilation ...},

abstract = {Abstract Variational four-dimensional (4D) data assimilation is performed using an adiabatic version of the National Meteorological Center (NMC) baroclinic spectral primitive equation model with operationally analyzed fields as well as simulated datasets. Two limited-memory quasi-Newton minimization techniques were used to iteratively find the minimum of a cost function, with the NMC forecast as a constraint. The cost function consists of a weighted square sum of the differences between the model forecast and observations over a time interval. In all the experiments described in this paper, observations are available for all degrees of freedom of the model. The derivation of the adjoint of the discretized adiabatic NMC spectral model is presented. The creation of this adjoint model allows the gradient of the cost function with respect to the initial conditions to be computed using a single backward-in-time integration of the adjoint equations. As an initial evaluation of the variational data-assimilation ...},

A least squares approach based on a large but finite set of observations generated at initial parameter estimates then gives a uniform approach to local identifiability, estimability, and the generation of an optimal sampling schedule. ?? 1985.},

abstract = {In most operational implementations of four-dimensional variational$\backslash$ndata assimilation (4D-Var), it is assumed that the model used in$\backslash$nthe data assimilation process is perfect or, at least, that errors$\backslash$nin the model can be neglected when compared to other errors in the$\backslash$nsystem. In this paper, we study how model error could be accounted$\backslash$nfor in 4D-Var. We present three approaches for the formulation of$\backslash$nweak-constraint 4D-Var: estimating explicitly a model-error forcing$\backslash$nterm, estimating a representation of model bias or, estimating a$\backslash$nfour-dimensional model state as the control variable. The consequences$\backslash$nof these approaches with respect to the implementation and the properties$\backslash$nof 4D-Var are discussed. We show that 4D-Var with an additional model-error$\backslash$nrepresentation as part of the control variable is essentially an$\backslash$ninitial-value problem and that its characteristics are very similar$\backslash$nto that of strong constraint 4D-Var. Taking the four-dimensional$\backslash$nstate as the control variable, however, leads to very different properties.$\backslash$nIn that case, weak-constraint 4D-Var can be interpreted as a coupling$\backslash$nbetween successive strong-constraint assimilation cycles. A possible$\backslash$nextension towards long-window 4D-Var and possibilities for evolutions$\backslash$nof the data assimilation system are presented.},

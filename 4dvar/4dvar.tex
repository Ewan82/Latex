\section{Introdution}

Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) has been used extensively in numerical weather prediction to improve forecasts REF. Currently efforts to use variational assimilation with carbon balance models have been limited REF, with sequential and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods being more prevelant REF. In this report we will paramterize a model of forest carbon balance (DALEC2) using a 4D-Var scheme in order to produce better forecasts of forest carbon balance. We will use data from the research site at Alice Holt forest run by Forest Research.  

\section{Methods}

Forecast skill score, $SS = 1 - \frac{MSE_{forecast}}{MSE_{ref}}$, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecast_skill

abstract = {In most operational implementations of four-dimensional variational$\backslash$ndata assimilation (4D-Var), it is assumed that the model used in$\backslash$nthe data assimilation process is perfect or, at least, that errors$\backslash$nin the model can be neglected when compared to other errors in the$\backslash$nsystem. In this paper, we study how model error could be accounted$\backslash$nfor in 4D-Var. We present three approaches for the formulation of$\backslash$nweak-constraint 4D-Var: estimating explicitly a model-error forcing$\backslash$nterm, estimating a representation of model bias or, estimating a$\backslash$nfour-dimensional model state as the control variable. The consequences$\backslash$nof these approaches with respect to the implementation and the properties$\backslash$nof 4D-Var are discussed. We show that 4D-Var with an additional model-error$\backslash$nrepresentation as part of the control variable is essentially an$\backslash$ninitial-value problem and that its characteristics are very similar$\backslash$nto that of strong constraint 4D-Var. Taking the four-dimensional$\backslash$nstate as the control variable, however, leads to very different properties.$\backslash$nIn that case, weak-constraint 4D-Var can be interpreted as a coupling$\backslash$nbetween successive strong-constraint assimilation cycles. A possible$\backslash$nextension towards long-window 4D-Var and possibilities for evolutions$\backslash$nof the data assimilation system are presented.},

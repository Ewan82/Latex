abstract = {Abstract Variational four-dimensional (4D) data assimilation is performed using an adiabatic version of the National Meteorological Center (NMC) baroclinic spectral primitive equation model with operationally analyzed fields as well as simulated datasets. Two limited-memory quasi-Newton minimization techniques were used to iteratively find the minimum of a cost function, with the NMC forecast as a constraint. The cost function consists of a weighted square sum of the differences between the model forecast and observations over a time interval. In all the experiments described in this paper, observations are available for all degrees of freedom of the model. The derivation of the adjoint of the discretized adiabatic NMC spectral model is presented. The creation of this adjoint model allows the gradient of the cost function with respect to the initial conditions to be computed using a single backward-in-time integration of the adjoint equations. As an initial evaluation of the variational data-assimilation ...},

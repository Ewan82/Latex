\section*{Introduction}
Motivation for understanding the information content of observations. Important for knowing when and which observations to take to give you the most information possible about the system.  

\section*{The DALEC model}
Background on DALEC model and how it is implemented in DA. State just five carbon pools, if estimating the parameters also state is approximately twenty elements.

\section*{Introduction to variational assimilation}
For our information content measures we use a variational assimilation framework. 3DVAR/4DVAR.

\section*{Information content measures}
A look at what information content measures are currently in use.

\section*{Shannon information content}
explanation of what $SIC$ is.
\subsection*{$SIC$ for a single observation at one time}
A analytic representation of $SIC$ for obs. at a single time. Show $NEE$'s $SIC$ dependence on temperature, net daily irradiance and $Cf$. Obs. of $NEE$ made in summer months provide more information than those made in winter. 
\subsection*{$SIC$ for successive observations over a time window}
Show information content when successive observations are added to our assimilation window. Begin with analytical form form successive observations of $Cf$. For $NEE$ seasonal cycle still clear, if assimilation window begins in summer a higher $SIC$ is reached over a shorter period (refer to graph in previous section). A single observation of $NEE$ made in summer provides the same level of information as 14 observations of $NEE$ made in winter.

\section*{Degrees of freedom for signal}
Only observing three carbon pools with $NEE$ does this mean max value $DOFS$ can attain is three?

Template for a LaTeX PhD UoReading Thesis.
====================================

Author: Emma Dodd
Mined bits from other latex templates

This template setup allows you to produce:
* a thesis that adheres to the UoR regulations
  (at least my interpretations of them)
* a nicely formatted pdf version of the same thesis
* individual documents for each chapter


The preface directory
---------------------
contains files for the preface.

info directory
---------------------
contains pdf of submission guidelines (from 2013).

chapter directory
---------------------
contains folders for each chapter which will be included in the thesis.pdf document when you compile thesis.tex.

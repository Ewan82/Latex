%Chapter 3:Is ERA-Interim data suitable for a `perfect’ data study in the Arctic?

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro3}

Meteorological reanalyses are datasets that are widely used in atmospheric science. They are produced using reanalysis, where an atmospheric forecast model is run in hindcast to assimilate climate and weather data from in situ observations and satellites into a coherent dataset. They are data driven, dynamically constrained datasets that provide data on a wide variety of atmospheric and climatic variables. Reanalysis datasets have some advantages over more traditional datasets for climate monitoring and research, especially for a `perfect' data study. They provide complete spatial and temporal coverage even in data sparse areas, can help to improve estimates of measured variables from data on related variables, can generate information on unobserved climate variables from observations of other variables, are more consistent than traditional datasets, and can provide more frequent data estimates than is available from in situ observations \citep{bromwich2007, dee2011, thorne2010}.

Reanalysis data is therefore very valuable for investigating temperatures in the Arctic, a data sparse area, due to the complete spatial and temporal coverage of these datasets. \citealt{jakobson2012} states that "reanalyses are arguably the best available source of integrated information on the four-dimensional structure of the atmosphere" and notes that, as a result, atmospheric reanalyses are often used in Arctic research to investigate climate variability, climate trends, large-scale circulations and teleconnections; to validate climate models; and to provide boundary conditions for ocean, sea ice, land-surface, and limited-area atmospheric models. However, it must be noted that reanalysis datasets contain only estimates of climatic variables. Reanalysis data will not contain the uncertainties and noise associated with actual data but can, however, contain biases, uncertainties and errors. Reanalysis is done using the latest and most sophisticated atmospheric models, but even the best models have errors \citep{dee2011}. Reanalyses can also contain biases which may be time varying making these datasets unsuitable for long-term trend monitoring (depending on the time, region and variable of interest)  \citep{thorne2010}. Uncertainties in reanalysis data will also be higher in certain areas and for certain variables due to sparse observational data \citep{inoue2009}. Meteorological reanalyses, although useful, must therefore be used with care and with consideration of the limitations of the datasets. 

This chapter examines how well ERA-Interim represents surface temperatures in the Arctic in order to attempt to determine whether ERA-Interim data is suitable for a `perfect' data study in the Arctic; "An Investigation into the Impact of using Various Techniques to Estimate Arctic Surface Air Temperature Anomalies" (Chapter~\ref{chap:interppaper} of this thesis). A review of the literature on reanalyses and their representation of Arctic temperatures was produced and this is given in Section~\ref{sec:litrev}. An investigation into the representation of Arctic SAT correlation length scales in ERA-Interim was conducted and this study is described in Section~\ref{sec:corrstruct}. Section~\ref{sec:conc} then draws on the conclusions of Sections~\ref{sec:litrev} and ~\ref{sec:conc} to try and determine whether ERA-Interim data is suitable for a `perfect' data study of Arctic Surface Air Temperatures (SATs).

\section{Meteorological Reanalysis Datasets and their Representation of the Arctic}
\label{sec:litrev}

Reanalysis of meteorological data was first found to be of use for atmospheric research after the First GARP (Global Atmospheric Research Program) Global Experiment (FGGE) in 1979 \citep{dee2011b}. Data from this experiment was reanalysed, as part of work investigating how to make better use of observations to initialise numerical weather forecasts, and it was subsequently realised that the reanalysis datasets were themselves useful for atmospheric research \citep{dee2011b, uppala2005}. Since then many reanalysis datasets have been produced by many organisations on both global and regional scales. Global scale reanalysis datasets, which provide reanalysis data for the Arctic, include the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts) Re-Analysis (ERA) reanalyses (ERA-15, ERA-40 and ERA-Interim), the NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) reanalyses (R1, R2 and CFSR), the JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency) JRA-25, JDCAS (a continuation of JRA-25) and JRA-55 reanalyses, the NASA MERRA (Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis) dataset, and the NOAA-CIRES (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences) 20th Century Reanalysis \citep{compo2011, dee2011b, ebita2011, gibson1997, jma2008, kalnay1996, kanamitsu2002, onogi2007, rienecker2011, saha2006, saha2010, schubert1993, uppala2005}. A regional reanalysis dataset has also been produced which covers the Arctic region; the Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR) \citep{bromwich2010}.

As mentioned previously, reanalysis data provides spatially and temporally complete coverage of meteorological variables and can therefore be very useful for investigating variables, such as SAT, in areas which are sparsely observed, such as the Arctic. However, although coverage is not an issue with these datasets they can still contain errors and biases. Here I provide a review of the literature on reanalyses and their representation of Arctic temperatures and temperature trends. 

\subsection{NCEP reanalyses}
\label{NCEP}

The first reanalysis produced by NCEP, in collaboration with NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research), was the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, also known as the NCEP R1, which covers the time period 1948 to present \citep{kalnay1996, saha2010}. Errors and biases were noted in NCEP R1 and, as a result, a corrected version of R1, often referred to as the NCEP or NCEP/DOE R2 dataset (hereafter referred to as NCEP R2), was produced to cover the time period 1979 to present (the satellite era) \citep{kanamitsu2002, saha2010}. However, despite the correction of many noted errors and updates to the system, only minor differences were found between the two NCEP reanalyses \citep{kanamitsu2002}. R1 and R2 continue to be produced at NCEP. In addition to these reanalyses a newer, coupled global NCEP reanalysis, which uses the new Climate Forecast System, known as the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) has been produced which covers the same time period as R2 but with a higher temporal and spatial resolution \citep{saha2006, saha2010}. Temperatures and temperature trends from the NCEP reanalyses have been compared to many observations of in situ temperatures. These studies and their results are summarised in this section.

NCEP R1 temperatures were compared with in situ rawinsonde observations over the Arctic Ocean from the Coordinated Eastern Arctic Research Experiment (CEAREX, September 1988 to May 1989) and the Lead Experiment (LeadEx, 16 March to 25 April 1992) \citep{bromwich2005}. R1 underestimated the mean monthly surface temperatures for the first few months of CEAREX by 2-3$^\circ$C \citep{bromwich2005}. After this R1 overestimated temperatures by 1-2$^\circ$C \citep{bromwich2005}. NCEP R1 was outperformed in this study by two ERA reanalysis (ERA-15 and ERA-40) in terms of the RMSEs (2.8$^\circ$C for NCEP compared to 2.4$^\circ$C for ERA-15 and 1.7$^\circ$C for ERA-40) \citep{bromwich2005}. All three reanalyses performed better in the warmer months of the time period investigated \citep{bromwich2005}. NCEP R1 SATs over sea ice were also compared to data from North Pole Drifting stations between 1954 and 2006 \citep{makshtas2007}. NCEP R1 showed good agreement with the North Pole Drifting station data generally, but there was a noticeable seasonality in the quality and biases of the SAT data from NCEP R1 \citep{makshtas2007}. SAT data from several reanalyses, including NCEP R1, were compared to SATs from meteorological stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network version 2 dataset and the Climate Anomaly Monitoring System (GHCNCAMS) dataset globally \citep{wang2011}. SATs over Arctic land areas, excluding the Greenland ice sheet, were estimated well by all of the reanalyses investigated in this study \citep{wang2011}. R1 was the least representative of the reanalyses, but the spatial patterns of global SAT were still well estimated in R1 \citep{wang2011}. This study also compared global mean SAT trends reproduced by the NCEP reanalyses with GHCNCAMS  trends \citep{wang2011}. R1 was outperformed by CFSR in terms of both interannual variability and long term trends \citep{wang2011}. SATs over Arctic land areas from various reanalyses, including NCEP R1, were also compared to monthly average land station data from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia \citep{lindsay2014}. Again the SATs, and SAT anomalies, were estimated well by most of the reanalyses investigated (including NCEP R1); there was a small warm bias in the winter of up to 2°C and a slightly larger cold bias in the summer \citep{lindsay2014}.

Temperature trends in the Arctic reconstructed by four reanalyses (ERA-40, ERA-Interim, JDCAS and NCEP R1) were compared to Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) data by \citealt{screen2011}. All reanalyses, apart from ERA-40, produced realistic trends in Arctic temperatures between 1957 to 2002  in the mid- and lower troposphere when compared to MSU data \citep{screen2011}. The trends in NCEP R1 were therefore found to be realistic \citep{screen2011}. However, when near surface air temperature trends in the Arctic from NCEP R1 were compared to International Arctic Buoy Programme (IABP) data by \citealt{alexeev2012} between 1979 and 2008, R1 was found to overestimate the rate of warming \citep{alexeev2012}. So the trends in NCEP R1 temperatures are realistic for the mid- and lower troposphere but overestimate the rate of warming near the surface.

SATs from NCEP R2 were investigated by \citealt{liu2008}, along with ERA-40, and compared to IABP/POLES (Polar Exchange at the Sea Surface) observations over the Arctic Ocean between 1979 and 1999. There was good agreement with the in situ observations of SATs in R2 and seasonal variations were reproduced well \citep{liu2008}. However, some biases were noted in NCEP R2 for Arctic SATs in this time period \citep{liu2008}. NCEP R2 had a warm bias for most months, but a small cold bias exists between May and September \citep{liu2008}. In addition the biases observed for SATs were not consistent spatially across the study area \citep{liu2008}. NCEP R2 has warm biases in the central Arctic Ocean and in marginal ice zones, but cold biases in the northern Greenland, Kara and Beaufort Seas \citep{liu2008}. There was a warm bias for the NCEP R2 annual mean of 0.7$^\circ$C \citep{liu2008}. NCEP R2 underestimated interannual variability in SATs and was noted to show an excessive warming trend \citep{liu2008}. However, NCEP R2 biases were sometimes smaller than ERA-40 biases in this study. NCEP R2 and several other reanalyses (JCDAS, NCEP CFSR, MERRA and ERA-Interim) were compared to meteorological data collected by the drifting ice station Tara between 2006 and 2007 by \citealt{jakobson2012} and the relative performance of the reanalyses was compared over the central Arctic ocean. The surface warm bias noted by \citealt{liu2008} for the central Arctic Ocean in NCEP R2 was also noted in the study by \citealt{jakobson2012}. RMSEs for air temperature were investigated and NCEP R2 performed fairly well overall. In addition, NCEP reanalyses produced the smallest RMSEs compared to other reanalysis datasets for temperatures close to the surface \citep{jakobson2012}. However, significant errors in SAT were also observed for some NCEP R2 profiles. NCEP R2 data was also compared to land area SATs from GHCNCAMS globally \citep{wang2011}. SATs over Arctic land areas, except for temperatures over the Greenland ice sheet, were estimated well by R2 \citep{wang2011}. R2 was slightly more representative for spatial patterns of global surface air temperature than R1 \citep{wang2011}. This shows that NCEP R2 produces realistic reconstructions of Arctic SAT patterns and outperforms NCEP R1 over Arctic land areas. This was also noted in the study by \citealt{lindsay2014}. When compared to SAT and SAT anomalies from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, NCEP R2 provided fairly good estimates of SATs and outperformed NCEP R1 \citep{lindsay2014}. However, there were still biases in the NCEP R2 SAT estimates and other reanalyses where found to outperform it for Arctic land areas \citep{lindsay2014}. In addition to investigations of temperature patterns in NCEP R2 the Arctic warming trend contained in NCEP R2 has also been investigated \citep{chung2013}. SAT anomalies from several reanalyses, including NCEP R2, were compared to GISTEMP temperature anomaly data between 1979 and 2011 with a 250 km smoothing \citep{chung2013}. The reanalyses (NCEP R2, NCEP CFSR, MERRA and ERA-Interim) show similar warming trends in the Arctic when compared to each other and to GISTEMP for SATs \citep{chung2013}. The spread in the warming trends for the reanalyses is larger in the winter than in the summer \citep{chung2013}. NCEP R1 and R2 near surface temperature trends were compared to IABP data as mentioned previously \citep{alexeev2012}. R2 overestimated temperatures around 1990 but then showed better agreement with the IABP dataset towards 2004, while R1 universally overestimated temperatures \citep{alexeev2012}. For global mean surface air temperature trends R2 was outperformed by CFSR but produced similar results when compared to R1 \citep{wang2011}. So NCEP R2 also produces realistic Arctic temperature trends and outperforms R1 for this variable.

As mentioned above, NCEP CFSR was investigated by \citealt{jakobson2012} in addition to other reanalyses. The results for NCEP CFSR were very similar to those for NCEP R2 \citep{jakobson2012}. NCEP CFSR performed better than NCEP R2 for air temperatures below 200 m and the profiles produced from NCEP CFSR did not contain the significant errors in SAT noted for some profiles from R2 \citep{jakobson2012}. CFSR was also shown to outperform the previous NCEP reanalyses in reconstructing global mean 
SAT trends by \citealt{wang2011}. Warming trends in CFSR were investigated by \citealt{chung2013} and the results were similar for all reanalyses as mentioned above. Temperature trends in CFSR were also investigated by \citealt{wang2011}. CFSR was the most representative of the NCEP analyses for spatial patterns of global SAT in general, as well as performing better over the Arctic than the previous NCEP reanalysis projects \citep{wang2011}. CFSR outperformed R1 and R2 in terms of both interannual variability and long term trends \citep{wang2011}. This was also found in the similar study by \citealt{lindsay2014}. CFSR outperformed R1 and R2, had smaller biases in its estimated SATs, and was one of the most representative renanalyses in this study \citep{lindsay2014}. CFSR therefore outperformes the previous NCEP reanalyses in terms of both Arctic temperatures and temperature trends.

\subsection{JRA-25, JDCAS and JRA-55}

The JMA's numerical assimilation and forecast system has been used to create global atmospheric reanalyses. JRA-25 was the first reanalysis and is available for the time period 1979-2004 \citep{onogi2007}. The aim of this analysis was to provide a global reanalysis dataset for climate research, operational monitoring and forecasts with an additional focus on creating a high quality analysis for Asia. Since 2004 the JRA-25 has been continued under a new name, JDCAS, and continues to run to the present day \citep{jma2008}. Production of a new 55 year reanalysis spanning 1958 to present, JRA-55 which will be continued as a new JDCAS in real time, started in 2010 \citep{ebita2011}. A comprehensive report on this new reanalysis is in preparation \citep{reana2013}.

The JCDAS reanalysis was validated by \citealt{jakobson2012} for the central Arctic Ocean. JDCAS was found to have the largest RMSE values of all of the reanalyses investigated in this study for the whole temperature profile \citep{jakobson2012}. JDCAS estimates of SATs were the least accurate of the reanalyses investigated for the Arctic Ocean in this time period \citep{jakobson2012}. In addition, significant errors in SAT were also observed for some JDCAS profiles \citep{jakobson2012}. Temperature trends in the Arctic as reconstructed by JCDAS were compared to MSU data along with other reanalyses by \citealt{screen2011}. All reanalyses produced realistic trends in Arctic temperatures in the mid- and lower troposphere when compared to MSU data, apart from ERA-40 \citep{screen2011}. ERA-Interim outperformed all other reanalyses, including JCDAS, in terms of realistic trends \citep{screen2011}. When compared to monthly average land station SAT data by \citealt{lindsay2014}, JRA-25 was found to perform quite well and had smaller errors and biases than NCEP R1, R2, CFSR (in some months), and the 20CR renanalysis \citep{lindsay2014}. It was one of the four most representative reanalyses in this study (along with ERA-Interim, NCEP CFSR, and NASA MERRA) \citep{lindsay2014}. Therefore, JDCAS was outperformed by other reanalyses in the Arctic over ocean and sea ice areas but it provides realistic SATs over Arctic land areas and realistic temperature trends compared to MSU.

\subsection{NASA MERRA reanalysis}

MERRA is NASA's reanalysis project for the satellite era (1979 to present) \citep{rienecker2011}. MERRA is created using version 5.2.0 of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) atmospheric model and data assimilation system (DAS) \citep{rienecker2008, rienecker2011}. A new reanalysis from 1980 to present, MERRA2, is expected to start production in November 2013 \citep{reana2013b}. MERRA2 will use a new version of GEOS-5 and will assimilate observations not available to MERRA in order to extend NASA reanalyses into the future \citep{reana2013b}.

The NASA MERRA reanalysis was, as mentioned previously, one of the reanalyses compared to air temperature data from the drifting ice station Tara by \citealt{jakobson2012}. The RMSE for MERRA air temperatures was found to be as good as the NCEP reanalyses overall \citep{jakobson2012}. But, MERRA was found to have a significant warm bias of about 2$^\circ$C for air temperature below 200 m \citep{jakobson2012}. MERRA was found to provide a good estimate of air temperatures above 200 m but was outperformed by NCEP CFSR for surface temperatures \citep{jakobson2012}. MERRA was also among the reanalyses whose Arctic warming trends investigated by \citealt{chung2013}. As mentioned previously, all of the reanalyses show similar warming trends in the Arctic when compared to each other and to GISTEMP for surface air temperatures \citep{chung2013}. When compared to SATs from Arctic land stations, MERRA provides good estimates of SATs and SAT anomalies and is one of the most representative reanalyses \citep{lindsay2014}. It outperforms NCEP R1, NCEP R2 and the 20CR reanalysis, and is comparable with NCEP CFSR and JRA-25, but is outperformed by ERA-Interim. MERRA is therefore realistic for Arctic temperatures but other reanalyses often outperform it.

\subsection{NOAA-CIRES 20th Century Reanalysis}

The 20th Century Reanalysis project, or 20CR, is a reanalysis which covers the most extensive time period out of any of the currently available reanalyses. 20CR is a comprehensive global atmospheric circulation dataset covering the time period 1871 to present \citep{compo2011}. The 20CR dataset only assimilates surface pressure reports with monthly sea-surface temperature and sea-ice distributions as boundary conditions, unlike other reanalyses which assimilate many in situ and satellite reports and many atmospheric variables \citep{compo2006, compo2011}.

The global surface air temperature trends in 20CR have been investigated and 20CR provides an independent confirmation of the global warming observed in temperature anomaly datasets, which are produced from in situ temperature measurements, without the use of station temperatures \citep{compo2013}. 20CR was also investigated for Arctic SATs by \citealt{lindsay2014} as mentioned previously. 20CR is the least representative reanalysis in this study \citep{lindsay2014}. A large winter bias is noted compared to monthly average SATs and a smaller bias in the summer. The correlation with SAT anomalies is quite poor in May \citep{lindsay2014}. This is attributed to a bad sea ice specification \citep{lindsay2014}. Therefore, in the few studies so far of the 20CR, it represnts global SAT trends well but is less representative of Arctic SATs over land than many currently avaliable reanalyses.

\subsection{Arctic System Reanalysis}

ASR is an Arctic specific analysis created using a Polar specific WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model \citep{bromwich2009, bromwich2010, hines2008, hines2011, wilson2011}. It is a high resolution regional reanalysis for the Arctic region \citep{bromwich2010}.

SATs have been investigated for the regional reanalysis ASR. The SATs from the Polar WRF model (version 2.2) were found to show good agreement with in situ observations of SATs and other variables collected at the drifting ice station from the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) study for January, July and August 1998 \citep{bromwich2009}. SATs from the Polar WRF model version 3.1 was compared with in situ observations and ERA-Interim data and were found to be in general agreement for spatial patterns in SATs over land areas \citep{hines2011, wilson2011}. However, ASR shows a cold bias of around 1$^\circ$C for most of the area studied, probably due to the model version used for this reanalysis \citep{wilson2011}. Some biases with a monthly  magnitude of less than 2$^\circ$C in ASR temperatures over land were also noted by \citealt{hines2011}. Therefore, the ASR seems to perform well for Arctic temperatures.

\subsection{ECMWF ERA reanalyses}

ECMWF first produce a reanalysis as part of the FGGE in 1979. After the value of reanalysis was recognised ECMWF continued to produced reanalysis datasets: ERA-15, ERA-40 and ERA-Interim. ERA-15, a 15 year reanalysis starting in 1979 and finishing in 1993, was the first ECMWF ERA reanalysis \citep{gibson1997}. The ERA-40 reanalysis project, 1957 to 2002, followed ERA-15 and benefited from an enhanced observing system (enhanced in preparation for the International Geophysical Year in 1957) as well as updates and changes which were informed by the ERA-15 project \citep{uppala2005}. ERA-Interim is the current ECMWF reanalysis dataset. It follows ERA-40 and was designed as an interim reanalysis of the period 1989-present in preparation for the extended reanalysis due to replace Era-40 \citep{dee2011b, ecmwf2008}. ERA-Interim has since been extended to 1979. A new ECMWF reanalysis, ERA-20C, is currently in production.

ERA-15 was one of three reanalyses compared to in situ rawinsonde datasets over the Arctic Ocean from CEAREX and LeadEX as mentioned in Section~\ref{NCEP} \citep{bromwich2005}. ERA-15 was found to overestimate mean temperature mean monthly surface temperatures for the first few months of CEAREX (September to November 1988) by about 2-3$^\circ$C, NCEP underestimated temperatures by about the same amount during this time period \citep{bromwich2005}. After this temperatures were overestimated in ERA-15 by 1-2$^\circ$C as in NCEP R1 \citep{bromwich2005}. ERA-15 outperformed NCEP R1 overall (RMSEs were lower, see Section~\ref{NCEP}) but was in turn outperformed by ERA-40 \citep{bromwich2005}.

In addition to the comparison with rawinsonde data study mentioned above, SATs from ERA-40 have also been investigated in the Arctic by comparing them to IABP/POLES observations from 1979-1999 by \citealt{liu2008}. The reanalysis generally showed good agreement with the in situ observations of SATs and seasonal variations were reproduced well, as was also found for NCEP R2 in this study \citep{liu2008}. However, some biases were observed despite this good agreement. ERA-40 had a consistent warm bias in all seasons, as well as a warm bias in the annual mean (1.48$^\circ$C) which was twice the size of the the annual mean warm bias in NCEP R2 \citep{liu2008}. The warm biases are also seen for almost every area of the Arctic \citep{liu2008}. This dataset also underestimates interannual variability in SATs \citep{liu2008}. ERA-40 was compared to SATs from GHCNCAMS globally \citep{wang2011}. ERA-40 showed the best correlation for SATs over land compared to the three NCEP reanalyses which were also investigated in this study \citep{wang2011}. So ERA-40 was found to produce SATs which show good agreement with in situ data. However, issues were noted in Arctic temperature trends in ERA-40 by \citealt{screen2011}. The performance of ERA-40 in the Arctic was assessed using various reference datasets from satellites, radiosondes and other reanalyses \citep{screen2011}. A discontinuity occuring in 1997 in ERA-40 was shown to lead to exaggerated warming of the Arctic troposphere in this dataset \citep{screen2011}. These issues were not observed in ERA-Interim \citep{screen2011}. This means that ERA-40 is not a good choice of reanalysis for examining Arctic temperature trends in recent decades \citep{screen2011}.

Era-Interim has also been found to perform well in depicting tropospheric temperatures over the Arctic as well as near surface temperature patterns \citep{dee2009, dee2011b, luepkes2010}. Era-Interim was found to outperform other reanalyses (ERA-40, JCDAS, NCEP CFSR, NCEP R2 and MERRA) in biases and root mean square error for air temperatures \citep{dee2009, jakobson2012, lindsay2014}. This is because ERA-Interim uses the observed SAT and background temperatures from the previous analysis time step in an optimal interpolation scheme rather than estimating the SAT by interpolating between the skin and lowest modelled temperatures \citep{dee2011b, lindsay2014}. However, Era-Interim does suffer from a warm bias in the lower 400 m layer of the atmosphere of up to 2$^\circ$C \citep{jakobson2012}. This bias was also noted by \citealt{luepkes2010} and is a long standing problem for the ECMWF reanalyses \citep{beesley2000, curry2002, jakobson2012, luepkes2010, screen2011, tastula2011, vihma2002}. ERA-Interim Arctic climate change trends were investigated along with other reanalysis datasets \citep{chung2013}. All investigated reanalyses, including ERA-Interim, showed similar warming trends in the Arctic when compared to each other and to GISTEMP for surface air temperatures \citep{chung2013}. The spread in the warming trends was larger in the winter than in the summer \citep{chung2013}. ERA-Interim was also found to reconstruct temperature trends in the Arctic well when compared to other reanalyses (ERA-40, JRA and NCEP R1) and satellite datasets by \citealt{screen2011}. ERA-Interim was found to produce the most realistic trends in Arctic temperatures in the mid- and lower troposphere out of the four reanalyses investigated in this study compared to MSU data \citep{screen2011}.  

\subsection{Conclusion}

For SATs in the Arctic, ERA-Interim performs very well when compared to other reanalyses. Despite a consistent warm bias near the surface ERA-Interim produces generally realistic estimates of Arctic temperatures and temperature trends. ERA-Interim also outperforms other reanalyses, including previous ECMWF reanalyses, in terms or surface temperature patterns, anomalies, biases and root mean square errors, and temperature trends in the studies identified. This is because ERA-Interim uses the observed SAT and background temperatures from the previous analysis time step in an optimal interpolation scheme rather than estimating the SAT by interpolating between the skin and lowest modelled temperatures \citep{dee2011b, lindsay2014}. As a consequence, its bias compared to observations is smaller, and its correlation higher, than for other reanalyses. Therefore, the literature discussed in this Section suggests that ERA-Interim is the most suitable reanalysis to use for a 'perfect' data study of the Arctic of the reanalyses currently available where sufficient research was identified in order to draw conclusions about the current reanalyses.

\section{An Investigation of the Representation of Arctic SAT Correlation Length Scales in ERA-Interim}
\label{sec:corrstruct}

\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:introcorr}

The purpose of this chapter is to determine whether ERA-Interim data is suitable for a `perfect' data study of Arctic Surface Air Temperatures (SATs); "An Investigation into the Impact of using Various Techniques to Estimate Arctic Surface Air Temperature Anomalies" which constitutes Chapter~\ref{chap:interppaper} of this thesis. Some of the various estimation techniques investigated in this study are techniques which interpolate and extrapolate SATs (`interpolating techniques'). Estimating temperature anomalies in the Arctic from sparse in situ data using interpolation and extrapolation allows us to produce a spatially complete estimation of climate change in the Arctic which is not available solely from in situ data. This means that that the whole of the Arctic can be represented in global averages of temperature change with estimated data rather than the Arctic being represented by sparse in situ data which only covers a small subset of the region.

In order to estimate Arctic SATs using interpolating techniques some assumptions about the correlation of SAT variations with distance are needed. An observation of a geophysical variable at a certain location will be more highly correlated with nearby observations of the same variable than observations further away; the correlation decreases with distance. The Correlation Length Scale (CLS) is an estimate of how fast the correlation will decrease with distance. For some interpolation techniques it is assumed that SAT anomalies records can be interpolated up to certain distance from a station. For example, the Linear Interpolation technique employed by the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Surface Temperature Analysis, hereafter referred to as GISTEMP, assumes that monthly SAT anomalies can be interpolated and extrapolated up to 1200 km distance from a station as this is the distance at which, on average, the correlation coefficient falls below 0.5 in middle and high latitudes \citep{hansen1987}. The CLS for temperature anomalies was used to determine the distance up to which anomalies could be interpolated. A linear weighting method is then used to weight SAT records according to distance from the point of interest. Other datasets also use a CLS to determind the weighting for an interpolation method. For example, the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature dataset uses a Simple Kriging method to interpolate a `weather field' as part of its method to interpolate SATs and create a temperature anomaly dataset. The CLS is assumed to be a good approximation for the covariance function as long as the variance changes slowly with time \citep{rohdesupp,rohde2013c}. The CLS is used to weight observations of SAT anomalies by distance so that observations further away are given less weight in the interpolation.

Therefore, when investigating the impact of using various techniques to estimate Arctic SAT anomalies using `perfect' reanalysis data, we need to be sure that the CLSs of the reanalysis data is close to the reality. If the CLS is not close to the reality in the data used for a `perfect' data study, then this will result in conclusions which do not reflect the actual performance of these estimation techniques. For example, if the reanalysis data had a CLS which was similar to the CLS assumed in a kriging method, when in reality the CLS for the Arctic was quite different, then the kriging method would appear to provide a very good reconstruction of Arctic SAT anomalies when if interpolating real data it would perform poorly. Consequently, it is important to investigate the CLS in ERA-Interim for the Arctic and establish how close it is to the reality as part of this chapter to determine whether ERA-Interim data is suitable for a `perfect' data study of Arctic Surface Air Temperatures (SATs).

\subsection{Data and Techniques}
\label{sec:methcorr}

The objective of this study was to investigate the Arctic correlation structure as represented in ERA-Interim reanalysis data and establish how close the correlation structure in ERA-Interim is to the reality. 

SAT anomaly fields were created from ERA-Interim SAT data between 1979 and 2011. Each grid cell had a time series of SAT anomalies between 1979 and 2011. These SAT anomaly fields were sub-sampled to produce 'station location' time series, the sample of ERA-Interim grid cell anomaly time series sampled at Arctic meteorological station locations. The Arctic was defined in this study as the area above 65$^\circ$N, which approximately matches the area northward of the Arctic circle while matching cleanly the grid cell edges of the ERA-Interim data. These station location time series were then cross correlated with the time series of SAT anomalies for each grid cell to produce a field of cross correlations.  The field of cross correlations were used to produce monthly and annual CLS for each station location. These CLSs were analysed and the monthly and annual CLS as represented in ERA-Interim was compared to the CLS reference for the Arctic.

\subsubsection{SAT Anomaly Fields}

ERA-Interim data for 2 metre SAT between 1979 and 2011 was downloaded from the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC). The SAT data is Reduced Gaussian Gridded data of surface/single level analyses in units of Kelvin at 6 hourly temporal resolution and 1.5$^\circ$ spatial resolution. Monthly SAT anomalies were produced for each ERA-Interim grid cell from this 6 hourly resolution ERA-Interim data between 1979 and 2011 relative to a 10 year climatology (1990-1999). A 10 year climatology was used instead of the conventional 30 year climatology in order to simulate the use of a conventional climatology in a longer dataset using ERA-Interim data which only covers 33 years. Annual anomalies for each grid cell were created from the monthly anomalies for each calendar year. The anomalies were subsequently detrended so that the correlation value was not correlating longer term trends in the temperature anomalies such as climate change.

These SAT anomaly fields from ERA-Interim will be used to create station location time series and will be cross correlated with these time series in order to determine the monthly CLS as represented in ERA-Interim.

\subsubsection{Station Location Time series}

'Station location' time series is the term used in this study for ERA-Interim data treated as if they were meteorological station data. The station location time series were the sample of ERA-Interim grid cell anomaly time series sampled at Arctic meteorological station locations. 

The locations in latitude and longitude of all meteorological stations in the GHCN-M v3 (Global Historical Climatology Network - Monthly version 3) mean surface air temperature dataset were obtained from the NOAA NCDC (National Climatic Data Center) website. All stations in the Arctic were identified regardless of whether they were operating in the time period analysed (1979-2011) or not. Eleven stations were ignored. This was because these stations are close enough to the locations of other stations to be duplicates of these stations at the grid resolution of ERA-Interim. 125 stations were identified. The location of all stations used can be seen in Figure~\ref{ch3fig1}. Station locations from GHCN-M v3 were chosen as many temperature anomaly datasets use the GHCN-M temperature records as the basis for their temperature anomalies; for example the GISTEMP and Berkeley Earth datasets.

\end{figure}
%ghcnstationlocations.ncl

Monthly and annual anomalies from the ERA grid cell nearest each station location were identified and these records were used as station location time series. The time series produced from ERA-Interim data are not in situ station data, but are analyses produced from in situ data, satellite data and the dynamical constraints of the ECMWF model.

\subsubsection{Reanalysis Arctic CLS}

The monthly and annual station location time series were cross correlated with the anomaly time series for each ERA-Interim grid cell contained in the SAT anomaly fields. This produced a field of monthly and annual cross correlation with distance from each station location. An example of the cross correlation of grid-cell annual average anomalies for the Waigatz station location can be seen in Figure~\ref{ch3fig2}.

\label{ch3fig2}
\end{figure}

A polynomial fit of the annual and monthly correlation with distance for each station location time series was produced. The polynomial fit was calculated by finding the average of all station location time series correlation values at each distance on monthly and annual time scales, producing binned averages of these average correlation values with 100 points in each bin, and then modifying the binned averages so that once the correlation value dropped to 0.001 all correlation values after that were set to 0. A polynomial fit to each of these sets of modified monthly and annual binned averages was produced and these constitute the monthly and annual CLS for each station. 100 points was chosen as the number of points for each bin as the bins needed to be smaller than the curvature of the average of all station location time series correlation values at each distance, about 100-200 km distance bins, and 100 points per bin fulfilled this requirement. The binned averaged were modified after the value dropped to near 0 as after this the correlations are not meaningful; the binned averages produced from ERA-Interim station location time series can have correlation values below 0 (negative correlations) and/or increase in correlation. The CLSs were then analysed and compared to the reference CLSs for the Arctic using graphs, maps and statistics.

\subsubsection{Reference Arctic CLS}

As part of the GISTEMP and Berkeley Earth temperature anomaly datasets investigated the correlation of temperature records with distance using meteorological station data \citep{hansen1987, rohdesupp}. Both investigated the annual CLS at various latitude bands across the earth \citep{hansen1987, rohdesupp}. In both studies it was found that for mid and high latitudes the correlation at 0 km station separation was nearly, but not quite, 1 before decreasing to $\sim$0.5 correlation at 1200 km and reaching 0 correlation at about 3000 km. In this study, because the ERA-Interim data does not contain the noise and inhomogeneities that cause the correlation at 0 km station separation to be not quite 1 the reference annual CLS will therefore be exactly 1 at 0 km. The reference annual CLS in this study, which ERA-Interim Arctic CLSs at annual time scales will be compared to, is illustrated in Figure~\ref{ch3fig3}.

The International Arctic Buoy Programme/Polar Exchange at the Sea Surface (IABP/POLES) SAT dataset is an optimally interpolated dataset of SATs in the Arctic \citep{rigor2000}. The monthly CLSs in the Arctic were assessed prior to production of the dataset as correlations are one of the critical parameters that need to be determined for an analysis produced by optimal interpolation\citep{rigor2000}. The monthly mean correlation at 0 km was found to be near to 1 for all seasons. The distance at which the mean correlations dropped below $1/e$ was found to be almost constant for autumn, winter and spring at about 1000 km while for summer the distance is shorter; about 300 km. The monthly mean CLS was found to be shorter in the summer compared to other seasons. This seasonal pattern in the Arctic monthly CLS has also been noted in other studies \citep[e.g.][]{przybylak1997, przybylak2003}. Again, in this study, because the ERA-Interim data does not contain noise and inhomogenieties the reference monthly CLS will be exactly 1 at 0 km. The reference monthly CLS in this study, which ERA-Interim Arctic CLSs at monthly time scales will be compared to, is illustrated in Figure~\ref{ch3fig4}.

\subsection{The CLS of Arctic SAT Anomalies at Annual Time Scales}
\label{sec:rescorrann}

The cross correlation of all station location time series were mapped and examined. Scatter plots of the correlation with distance were also plotted with the CLS (the polynomial fit to the binned averages) for all station location time series. At annual time scales, some station location time series' spatial correlations and CLSs fit with the reference CLS. Maps and scatter plots for some station locations which have CLSs that fit with the reference CLSs for the Arctic are given in Figures~\ref{ch3fig5} and ~\ref{ch3fig6}. These stations have areas within 1200 km of the station (shown by the black circle) which a correlation coefficient that is generally 0.5 or more and the annual CLS for these station locations are also similar to the reference CLS. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\label{ch3fig6}
\end{figure}

However, some station location time series have annual spatial correlations and CLSs which do not fit with the reference CLS. Maps and scatter plots for some station locations which have CLSs that do not fit with the reference CLSs for the Arctic are given in Figures~\ref{ch3fig5} and ~\ref{ch3fig6}. Some, such as the Alert station location, have a very directional correlation and, as a result, have annual CLSs which are not similar to the reference CLS. For others, such as Danmarkshavn and Nord Ads, much of the area within 1200 km of the station (shown by the black circle) has a correlation coefficient of less than 0.5 and they therefore have annual CLSs which do not fit with the reference CLS.

\label{ch3fig8}
\end{figure}

So, some station location time series have annual CLSs which are similar to the reference while others do not. But, are the station location time series which have CLSs which are similar to the reference CLS in the minority or do they make up a significant proportion of Arctic station location time series at annual time scales? The binned averages of the cross correlation of grid-cell annual average anomalies for all station locations and the annual CLS produced from these binned averages (polynomial fit curve fitted to the modified binned averages) were plotted and compared to the reference annual CLS for the Arctic (Figure~\ref{ch3fig9}). The annual CLS for the Arctic as represented in ERA-Interim is very similar to the reference annual CLS for the Arctic as determined from previous studies. The two curves are identical for many distances. The cross correlation at 1200 km for each station location was graphed and compared to the reference correlation value at 1200 km (0.5, Figure~\ref{ch3fig10}). 58.4\% of the station location time series analysed have annual correlation values of less than 0.5 at 1200 km distance and therefore do not fit with the reference CLS. This shows that, on average, the representative of the annual Arctic CLS in ERA-Interim is almost identical to the reference CLS. However, slightly more than half of the station locations investigated have correlations of less than the reference correlation values. This means that the majority of stations have shorter annual CLS than reference.

\end{figure}
%annbarchart.ncl

The cross correlation at 1200 km for each station location was also mapped (Figure~\ref{ch3fig11}) to investigate the spatial pattern, if any, of the annual correlation values. Most of the station location time series in Russia and in the Nunavut and Northwest Territories of Canada have correlations of 0.5 or more at 1200 km and therefore fit the reference CLS. Station locations in Alaska have correlations of 0.4 to 0.3 at 1200 km. Station locations in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic (Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard and Scandinavia) have short CLS, below 0.3 correlation at 1200 km. Therefore there seems to be a spatial pattern in the CLS as represented in ERA-Interim.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\label{ch3fig11}
\end{figure}
%annpointmap.ncl

On average the CLS for annual Arctic SAT anomalies as represented in ERA-Interim are almost identical to the reference CLS. Almost half of the station locations have correlations at 1200 km that fit with the reference value (0.5). These stations are generally located in Russia and in the Nunavut and Northwest Territories of Canada. However, 58.4\% of the station location time series analysed have annual correlation values of less than 0.5 at 1200 km distance and therefore do not fit with the reference CLS. These stations are generally located in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic. 

\subsection{The Correlation Structure of Arctic SAT Anomalies at Monthly Time Scales}
\label{sec:rescorrmon}

In many of the station location time series analysed it was noticed that in the summer months (June, July and August) the CLS was much shorter than in other seasons. The mapped correlation and the scatter plot of correlation with distance for one example station is shown in Figures~\ref{ch3fig12} and ~\ref{ch3fig13}. For this example station the CLS is shorter in the summer. The mean correlations were above $1/e$ at 1000 km in most months and above $1/e$ at 300 km in June, July and August. The monthly CLS for this station fits with the reference monthly CLS in the Arctic. Is this seasonal pattern in correlation length scales, which is similar to the reference monthly CLS for the Arctic, the general pattern for Arctic station location time series in ERA-Interim?

\begin{figure}[htbp]

}
\label{ch3fig13}
\end{figure}
%annpointmap.ncl


The monthly correlation value for each station location time series at 1000 km and the average monthly correlation value across all station location time series at 1000 km was plotted (Figure~\ref{ch3fig14}). Figure~\ref{ch3fig14} shows that there is a seasonal pattern for the majority of station location time series and on average; correlation values at 1000 km are smaller in the summer months. Therefore correlation length scales, for the majority of Arctic station
location time series and on average, are much shorter in the summer than in the
winter as represented in ERA-Interim. This fits with the reference seasonal pattern for Arctic CLSs. The average of the station location time series monthly correlation values in most months, excluding the summer months, are $\sim$0.4 at 1000 km. This is close to the reference CLS at 1000 km for these months. However, the majority of station location time series have correlation values which are around 0.6 at 1000 km in non-summer months. This suggests that the ERA-Interim CLS are close to the reference on average for most months but that the majority of stations have longer CLSs than reference. For June, July and August the average of the station location time series monthly correlation values are $\sim$0.6 at 300 km as shown in Figure~\ref{ch3fig145}. This is larger than the reference CLS at 300 km for these months. In addition, the majority of station location time series have correlation values which are above the reference correlation value at 300 km. This suggests that, for summer months, the CLS as represented in ERA-Interim is longer than reference, both on average and for the majority of time series.

The binned averages of the cross correlation of grid-cell monthly average anomalies for all station locations and the monthly CLS produced from these binned averages (polynomial fit curve fitted to the modified binned averages) were plotted and compared to the reference monthly CLS for the Arctic (Figure~\ref{ch3fig14}). The average monthly CLS from station location time series is, for many months, quite similar to the reference monthly CLS. For all months except the summer months the average CLS as represented in ERA-Interim is very similar to the reference and the CLS at 1000 km is slightly above $1/e$. For June, July and August average monthly CLS from station location time series is smaller than in other months. However, the monthly CLS as represented in ERA-Interim is not as similar to the reference compared to other months. The correlation at 300 km is around 0.8 rather than the reference value of $1/e$. Therefore, on average, the monthly CLS for most months is close to the reference. In summer the CLS produced from station location time series is shorter than in other months, but is not as short as reference; the CLS at 300 km is 0.8 rather than $1/e$. This means that, on average, the CLS as represented in ERA-Interim is longer than the reference values. This fits with the results shown in Figure~\ref{ch3fig145} and discussed previously.

In conclusion, there is a seasonal pattern in the correlation at 100 km for almost all of the station location time series analysed. CLSs
are much shorter in the summer months than in spring, autumn and
winter. For most months the monthly correlation value at 1000 km is, on average, close to the reference correlation value for the Arctic at this distance. However, the majority of station location time series have longer CLSs than reference in these months. For summer months, both for the majority of station location time series' correlation values at 300 km and for the average correlation value at 300 km across all station location time series', the CLSs are longer than reference. This pattern is also seen in the average monthly CLS for Arctic station locations in ERA-Interim; for most months the CLSs are close to the reference CLS but for summer months the CLSs are longer than reference. 

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:disscorr}

For annual and monthly CLSs for Arctic SAT anomalies as represented in ERA-Interim the CLSs are, in general, close to the reference annual and monthly CLSs identified in previous studies. On average the CLS for annual Arctic SAT anomalies as represented in ERA-Interim are almost identical to the reference CLS and almost half of the station locations have correlations at 1200 km that fit with the reference value (0.5). However, over 50\% of the station location time series analysed have annual correlation values of less than 0.5 at 1200 km distance and therefore do not fit with the reference CLS. There seems to be a spatial pattern in the CLSs as represented in ERA-Interim; stations which fit which the reference CLS are generally located in Russia and in the Nunavut and Northwest Territories of Canada while stations which do not fit the reference CLS are generally located in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic. At monthly time scales there is a seasonal pattern in the correlation values at 100 km for almost all of the station location time series analysed; CLSs are much shorter in the summer months than in spring, autumn and winter. For most months, excluding the summer months, the monthly correlation value at 1000 km is, on average, close to the reference correlation value for the Arctic at this distance. The monthly average CLS for these months is also close to the reference. However, the majority of station location time series have longer CLSs than reference in these months. For summer months, for the majority of station location time series' correlation values at 300 km, for the average correlation value at 300 km across all station location time series' and for the average monthly CLS, the CLSs are found to be longer than reference.

In conclusion the CLSs as represented in ERA-Interim are generally close to the reference, except for the summer months where the CLSs are often longer than reference. The CLSs of ERA-Interim reanalysis data is generally close to the reality except for summer months.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

For SATs in the Arctic, ERA-Interim performs very well when compared to other reanalyses. Despite a consistent warm bias near the surface ERA-Interim produces generally realistic estimates of Arctic temperature and temperature trends. ERA-Interim also outperforms other reanalyses, including previous ECMWF reanalyses, in terms or surface temperature patterns, biases and root mean square errors, and temperature trends. ERA-Interim also performs fairly well in terms of it's representation of annual and monthly Arctic SAT anomaly correlation length scales. Therefore, based on the literature discussed in this Chapter and the investigation undertaken as part of this Chapter into the representation of Arctic SAT correlation length scales in ERA-Interim, ERA-Interim is determined in this Chapter to be the most suitable reanalysis to use for a ` perfect' data study of the Arctic of the reanalyses currently available.

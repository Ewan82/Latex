%Forests and terrestrial ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon cycle, removing large amounts of CO\(_2\) from the atmosphere and thus helping to mitigate the effect of human-induced climate change. Land surface carbon uptake is the most uncertain process in current estimates of the global carbon cycle. There is much disagreement on whether forests and terrestrial ecosystems will continue to remove the same percentage of CO\(_2\) from the atmosphere under future emission scenarios. It is therefore important to improve understanding of ecosystem carbon cycle processes in context of a changing climate. 

%In this talk we explore new techniques to improve estimates of ecosystem carbon uptake, with focus on the Alice Holt research forest in Hampshire. We then use these techniques, along with complimentary measurements obtained from an extensive fieldwork campaign, to better understand the effect of selective felling on the carbon dynamics of the Alice Holt forest. The response of ecosystem carbon uptake to land use change and disturbance (e.g. fire, felling, insect outbreak) is another large uncertainty in the global carbon cycle. Our methods represent a novel way to help elucidate this response.

%Forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle, removing large amounts of CO\(_2\) from the atmosphere and thus helping to mitigate the effect of human-induced climate change. The state of the global carbon cycle in the IPCC AR5 suggests that the land surface is the most uncertain component of the global carbon cycle.  The response of ecosystem carbon uptake to land use change and disturbance (e.g. fire, felling, insect outbreak) is a large component of this uncertainty. A main cause for the high level of uncertainty in terrestrial carbon balance predictions arise from significant gaps in current direct observations and poor parameterisations or missing processes in current modelled predictions. The mathematical technique of data assimilation presents a method for combing incomplete observational records with modelled predictions in order to find the best estimate for the state and parameter variables of a system. Data assimilation has risen to prominence in the field of numerical weather prediction where it has contributed to significant improvements in model forecasts. More recently data assimilation has been used to improve our knowledge of land surface carbon cycle processes. This field is still relatively new and underdeveloped in comparison with numerical weather prediction.

%In this thesis we aim to develop novel data assimilation techniques for the terrestrial carbon cycle. There are three main areas which we address; Understanding the information content in observations for data assimilation, Improving the characterisation of uncertainties in both prior model and observational estimates and using data assimilation to understand the effect of disturbance on the carbon dynamics of a managed woodland.

%It is important to understand which observations can add most information to data assimilation schemes so that choices for field campaigns can be made more sophisticatedly and the most uncertain components of land surface models constrained. In order to better understand information content and improve data assimilation results it is also imperative that we improve the characterisation and estimates of errors in our data assimilation schemes. Using these novel data assimilation techniques along with supplementary observations from a field work campaign we attempt to improve understanding of the effect of selective felling on forest carbon dynamics.         

%Additionally, there is much disagreement on whether forests and terrestrial ecosystems will continue to remove the same proportion of CO\(_2\) from the atmosphere under future climate regimes. It is therefore important to improve our understanding of ecosystem carbon cycle processes in the context of a changing climate.

Land surface carbon uptake and its response to disturbance (e.g. fire, felling, insect outbreak) are the most uncertain components in the global carbon cycle. This uncertainty arises from significant gaps in current direct observations and poor parameterisations or missing processes in current modelled predictions. Data assimilation provides a methodology for combining incomplete observational records with modelled predictions to find the best estimate of the state and parameter variables for a given system. In this thesis, we develop novel data assimilation techniques for the terrestrial carbon cycle through the implementation of four-dimensional variational data assimilation to combine a simple model of forest carbon balance with observations from the Alice Holt forest in Hampshire, UK.
The first aim of the thesis is concerned with understanding the information content in observations for data assimilation. It is important to understand which observations add most information to data assimilation schemes in order to better constrain future model predictions. We use information content measures relying on the derivative of the model code. Through the application of these measures we show that the information content in carbon balance observations can vary with time and different representations of error. 
We next seek to improve the characterisation of uncertainties for prior model estimates and observations. We propose including novel correlations between errors within ecosystem carbon balance data assimilation schemes. We judge the impact of these correlations by running a set of data assimilation experiments for the Alice Holt forest. By including correlations, the error in our 14 year model forecast of forest carbon uptake was reduced by 44\%.
Finally, we use the data assimilation techniques developed along with supplementary fieldwork observations to investigate the effect on forest carbon dynamics of disturbance from selective felling. We show that a selective felling event at the Alice Holt forest had no significant effect on forest carbon uptake. Our most confident model estimate, combining all available observations, suggests that reductions in gross primary productivity lead to equivalent reductions in total ecosystem respiration.

abstract = {Numerical Optimization presents a comprehensive and up-to-date description of the most effective methods in continuous optimization. It responds to the growing interest in optimization in engineering, science, and business by focusing on the methods that are best suited to practical problems. Drawing on their experiences in teaching, research, and consulting, the authors have produced a textbook that will be of interest to students and practitioners alike. Each chapter begins with the basic concepts and builds up gradually to the best techniques currently available. Because of the emphasis on practical methods, as well as the extensive illustrations and exercises, the book is accessible to a wide audience. It can be used as a graduate text in engineering, operations research, mathematics, computer science, and business. It also serves as a handbook for researchers and practitioners in the field. Above all, the authors have strived to produce a text that is pleasant to read, informative, and rigorous - one that reveals both the beautiful nature of the discipline and its practical side. MMOR Mathematical Methods of Operations Research, 2001: "The book looks very suitable to be used in an graduate-level course in optimization for students in mathematics, operations research, engineering, and others. Moreover, it seems to be very helpful to do some self-studies in optimization, to complete own knowledge and can be a source of new ideas.... I recommend this excellent book to everyone who is interested in optimization problems."},

abstract = {We conducted an inverse modeling analysis, using a variety of data streams (tower-based eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange, NEE, of CO2, chamber-based measurements of soil respiration, and ancillary ecological measurements of leaf area index, litterfall, and woody biomass increment) to estimate parameters and initial carbon (C) stocks of a simple forest C-cycle model, DALEC, using Monte Carlo procedures. Our study site is the spruce-dominated Howland Forest AmeriFlux site, in central Maine, USA. Our analysis focuses on: (1) full characterization of data uncertainties, and treatment of these uncertainties in the parameter estimation; (2) evaluation of how combinations of different data streams influence posterior parameter distributions and model uncertainties; and (3) comparison of model performance (in terms of both predicted fluxes and pool dynamics) during a 4-year calibration period (1997-2000) and a 4-year validation period ("forward run", 2001-2004). We find that woody biomass increment, and, to a lesser degree, soil respiration, measurements contribute to marked reductions in uncertainties in parameter estimates and model predictions as these provide orthogonal constraints to the tower NEE measurements. However, none of the data are effective at constraining fine root or soil C pool dynamics, suggesting that these should be targets for future measurement efforts. A key finding is that adding additional constraints not only reduces uncertainties (i.e., narrower confidence intervals) on model predictions, but at the same time also results in improved model predictions by greatly reducing bias associated with predictions during the forward run.},

@article{Sulzman2005,
abstract = {In an old growth coniferous forest located in the central Cascade Mountains, Oregon, we added or removed aboveground litter and terminated live root activity by trenching to determine sources of soil respiration. Annual soil efflux from control plots ranged from 727 g C m(-2) year(-1) in 2002 to 841 g C m(-2) year(-1) in 2003. We used aboveground litter inputs 149.6 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and differences in soil CO2 effluxes among treatment plots to calculate contributions to total soil efflux by roots and associated rhizosphere organisms and by heterotrophic decomposition of organic matter derived from aboveground and belowground litter. On average, root and rhizospheric respiration (R-r) contributed 23\%, aboveground litter decomposition contributed 19\%, and belowground litter decomposition contributed 58\% to total soil CO2 efflux, respectively. These values fall within the range of values reported elsewhere, although our estimate of belowground litter contribution is higher than many published estimates, which we argue is a reflection of the high degree of mycorrhizal association and low nutrient status of this ecosystem. Additionally, we found that measured fluxes from plots with doubled needle litter led to an additional 186 g C m(-2) year(-1) beyond that expected based on the amount of additional carbon added; this represents a priming effect of 187\%, or a 34\% increase in the total carbon flux from the plots. This finding has strong implications for soil C storage, showing that it is inaccurate to assume that increases in net primary productivity will translate simply and directly into additional belowground storage.},

@article{Zhou2013,
abstract = {Understanding the dominant variables driving soil respiration is critically important for predicting soil CO2 emission and assessing the carbon balance of forest ecosystems. In a small catchment of the semiarid Loess Plateau in China, soil respiration and soil biophysical factors were studied on sites of five forest types, comprising plots established in a pure Pinus tabulaeformis plantation, a pure Robinia pseudoacacia plantation, a mixed P. tabulaeformis and R. pseudoacacia plantation, a pure Platycladus orientalis plantation, and a natural Populus davidiana stand. Soil temperature at the 10 cm depth was found to be the most predominant factor controlling the temporal pattern of soil respiration, accounting for 11-40\% seasonal variation in the rate of soil CO2 efflux across forest types. By applying an empirical model and the calculated temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q10) and the rate of basal soil respiration (R10), annual soil CO2 emission was estimated separately for each forest type using the automatically monitored data of soil temperature at the 10 cm depth. The annual soil CO2 emission varied greatly with forest types and ranged from 647.71 g C m-2 y-1 in the P. orientalis plantation to 1448.50 g C m-2 y-1 in the natural P. davidiana stand. Annual soil CO2 efflux is better predicted by soil organic carbon content and the amount of carbon in roots, litter and top soil than soil temperature when data are pooled for all plots of the five forest types. A first order exponential analysis indicates that about 77\% of the variation in annual soil CO2 efflux is explained by root carbon stock, 63\% by the combined carbon stock in roots, litter, and top soil, and 48\% by the combined carbon stock in litter and top soil. We conclude that annual soil CO2 efflux can be predicted by carbon pools in roots and soils rather than by soil temperature in watersheds where spatial variation in soil temperature is relatively small in the semiarid Loess Plateau of China. © 2012.},

@article{Cardinali2004,
abstract = {The influence matrix is used in ordinary least-squares applications for monitoring statistical multiple-regression analyses. Concepts related to the influence matrix provide diagnostics on the influence of individual data on the analysis - the analysis change that would occur by leaving one observation out, and the effective information content (degrees of freedom for signal) in any sub-set of the analysed data. In this paper, the corresponding concepts have been derived in the context of linear statistical data assimilation in numerical weather prediction. An approximate method to compute the diagonal elements of the influence matrix (the self-sensitivities) has been developed for a large-dimension variational data assimilation system (the four-dimensional variational system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). Results show that, in the boreal spring 2003 operational system, 15\% of the global influence is due to the assimilated observations in any one analysis, and the complementary 85\% is the influence of the prior (background) information, a short-range forecast containing information from earlier assimilated observations. About 25\% of the observational information is currently provided by surface-based observing systems, and 75\% by satellite systems. 
Low-influence data points usually occur in data-rich areas, while high-influence data points are in data-sparse areas or in dynamically active regions. Background-error correlations also play an important role: high correlation diminishes the observation influence and amplifies the importance of the surrounding real and pseudo observations (prior information in observation space). Incorrect specifications of background and observation-error covariance matrices can be identified, interpreted and better understood by the use of influence-matrix diagnostics for the variety of observation types and observed variables used in the data assimilation system.
